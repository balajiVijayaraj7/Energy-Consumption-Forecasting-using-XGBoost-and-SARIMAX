# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting
Accurate forecasting of energy consumption plays a pivotal role in optimizing resource planning, decision-making, and operational efficiency in the energy industry. This project aims to develop a predictive model using the XGBoost and SARIMAX algorithms to accurately forecast energy consumption for a given time period. Leveraging time series analysis and machine learning techniques, the model captures the complex and dynamic nature of energy systems, enabling more reliable predictions. The project identifies areas where the model exhibits deviations or inaccuracies in its predictions. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with promising performance metrics on both training and test sets. Furthermore, the project explores the top errors and provides insights into areas where improvements can be made. By addressing these challenges and leveraging advanced techniques, this project contributes to cost reduction, sustainability, and improved energy management strategies in the energy industry. The findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders in optimizing energy supply chains and implementing demand response programs.
